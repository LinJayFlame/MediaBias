Our experiences are increasingly the result of a blend of natural and artificial influence. For now ... [+] the space of each is still clearly distinguishable, But for how much longer?

Much has been said and written about AI and the future of work. Maybe the time has come to expand our scope to envision and plan for AI and the future of life—everything from making music and navigating relationships to brokering peace global accords. The exponential growth of AI in recent months opens space to think that its influence on our existence might be far wider than an increase in performance and productivity.

Imagine a future when our thoughts intermingle with AI in a vast, global cognitive ecosystem. Much like the interconnected web of life in a rainforest, our ideas could cross-pollinate with AI-generated concepts, creating a noosphere—the sphere of human consciousness and mental activity in an organic interplay with the biosphere—of unprecedented diversity and complexity.

Recent experiments with brain-computer interfaces hint at this future. Although the trials were highly controversial (- and cannot be considered a success considering that the test monkey died) Neuralink's monkey trials show primates controlling computers with their minds. What if, instead of just helping paralyzed individuals communicate, these interfaces evolve into a two-way street of continuous idea exchange between human and artificial minds? Human-brain synchrony still has a touch of science fiction, yet it is not as far out as it appears, it may lead to the co-evolution of natural and artificial intelligences.

Such a cognitive symbiosis could redefine creativity. The AI-human collaboration in drug discovery by Insilico Medicine demonstrates how AI can enhance human creativity in complex problem-solving. Imagine this concept applied to arts—a musician whose melodies are instantly harmonized by an AI, or a poet whose verses are complemented by AI-generated imagery, creating a new form of sync-aesthetic expression that engages multiple senses simultaneously.

Contrary to fears of AI making us less human, what if it deepens our capacity for empathy? AI-powered emotion recognition is already a reality. Now, let's take it a step further.

Envision AI systems that not only recognize emotions but help us understand and experience them more fully. An AI-emotion interpreter could serve as an "empathy engine" translating complex emotional states across cultures. This emotional augmentation could revolutionize fields like diplomacy and conflict resolution. AI-powered negotiation support systems are already being developed, potentially paving the way for AI mediators that could help warring factions truly understand each other's perspectives.

It might also serve to debunk the human assumption that other species do not think or feel. The WildBook project, which uses AI to identify individual animals and track their behaviors, offers a glimpse into how AI might help us understand non-human experiences. This might be a step into a future when we develop a more respectful relationship with nature and animals because we are able to emphasize and communicate with them.

AI could become the architect of our own evolution. With advances in CRISPR gene editing technology and AI's ability to process vast amounts of genetic data, we might see AI-guided evolution under human supervision.

This isn't about creating "designer babies," but rather about AI helping us adapt to an environment that is evolving due to accelerating climate change more rapidly than our biological system is ready to adjust to. DeepMind's AlphaFold has already revolutionized our understanding of protein folding. Imagine this technology applied to help us thrive in new conditions—perhaps enhancing our ability to conserve water or tolerate extreme temperatures.

Moreover, AI could help us tap into the vast potential of our microbiome. AI analysis of the gut microbiome is already yielding insights into human health. Imagine personalized AI-designed probiotic cocktails that enhance not just our physical health, but our mental wellbeing and cognitive capabilities.

As we set our sights on becoming a multiplanetary species, AI might pave the way. Rather than human astronauts, the first Martian settlers could be AI-powered robots, terraforming the red planet for human habitation. NASA's AI-guided AEGIS system on the Mars rovers offers a glimpse of how AI can autonomously explore alien environments.

These AI pioneers could experiment with various approaches to create a livable environment, learning and adapting far faster than any human team. By the time humans arrive, they might find a burgeoning ecosystem, crafted by AI to be as welcoming as possible to terrestrial life.

Perhaps the most profound impact of AI will be on our collective decision making. Imagine an AI system that can aggregate and synthesize the knowledge, opinions, and values of billions of people in real-time.

This global wisdom network could transform governance, allowing for a form of hyperdemocracy where every voice is truly heard and considered. Projects like Polis, an AI-powered platform for large-scale deliberation, offer a glimpse of this potential future. It could help us tackle global challenges like climate change by finding innovative solutions that balance the needs of all stakeholders.

As we embark on this journey of human-AI symbiosis, the LIFE framework might guide our path:

The future of life in the age of AI isn't about subjugation or replacement, but symbiosis—if we configure it that way with the stated ambition to bring out the best in and for people and planet. It could be a future where the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence blur, creating a new form of life that is more than the sum of its parts. Whether that happens depends on the choices that we make now, and the mindset that underpins them.

A perspective of AI and ourselves that prioritizes the wellbeing of humans and nature, whilst considering AI as a tool for which humans remain accountable, might be the entry ticket to a more inclusive future, where everyone, everywhere as a fair chance to fulfill their potential. LIFE may serve to curate such a mindset and the personal agency that flows from it.

We have the opportunity to write the most extraordinary chapter yet in the story of life on Earth—and beyond. Will we seize it?
