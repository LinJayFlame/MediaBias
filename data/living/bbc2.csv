"The importance of using tech efficiently and responsibly to improve our circumstances goes beyond the upgrading of the workplace, to touch almost every facet of modern life."
Empowering employees through the digital economy:
"Leading businesses are helping close skills gaps through accessible online education, enabling workers in all industries to engage in more meaningful, satisfying work while achieving a healthier work/life balance."
Guarding against global crises:
"As our economies, cultures and societies draw closer together, all manner of major crises � from financial crashes to rapidly spreading viruses � are impacting every country. Technology is an essential tool for dealing with such large-scale disasters. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), automation, cloud computing, data collection and management enable authorities to understand the scale and impact of a crisis and react more quickly and efficiently."
Protecting the environment through sustainability:
" Technology is enabling businesses to operate more sustainably from the ground up, and move towards a circular economy. For example, through improved waste reduction/recycling methods, smart building environmental controls and renewable energy production, organisations are building less wasteful supply chains and operational practices."
Protecting people and boosting equality:
"Sustainability extends to the human elements of the economy as well as environmental. For example, businesses can use tracking technology to ensure their suppliers are ethical in their sourcing and distribution methods. They can more easily implement responsible buying, endorse human rights protection acts and work with regulatory authorities to create better safeguards for employees, suppliers and consumers. "
"AI, robotics and automation:"
"Freeing humans from repetitive tasks to engage in more creative, meaningful work continues to be a life-changing adjustment for millions of people worldwide. These technologies have the ability to unlock human potential by supplementing their skills with machine-based support. For example, by raising societal inclusion for PwDs (persons with disabilities) through driverless vehicle technology or allowing farmers in developing countries to track fair market prices and improve crop yields through smart agriculture methodologies."
3D printing:
"This technology may still be in its adolescence, but it has the potential to revolutionise the creation of physical infrastructure by making it vastly cheaper while also reducing its ecological impact. Increasingly, companies are experimenting with a vast range of applications, from creating office buildings in a sustainable manner to quick, customisable production of incubators, prosthetics and even braille learning aids, accessible to developing parts of the world."
Voice assistants and NLP (natural language processing):
"These technologies are driving inclusion in society, bringing PwDs greater access to digital commerce, new career paths and inclusive social experiences. We can expect organisations to continue this trend as they grow in sophistication, realising the ambitions of those citing advanced use cases such as predictive policing and comprehensive personal assistants."
Technologies creating the circular economy:
"Companies are playing their part in helping society transition to a �zero-waste� circular economy. Intelligent use of innovations such as chemical recycling, vertical farming, non-plastic/edible packaging, electric vehicles and blockchain are being implemented to improve transparency in their supply chains."
"Technologies are an expanding force for good, either in isolation or used together as increasingly interconnected systems. Practically every element of our lives can benefit from the touch of technological enhancement, and each passing year brings new and exciting stories of how organisations put this theory into practice in India and around the world."
Agriculture:
"India continues to experience widespread agricultural challenges, including unpredictable weather patterns and a lack of access to smart farming methodologies. However, emerging innovative Indian start-ups are making use of hyperspectral imaging and drones to prevent crop losses, by providing farmers with accurate weather predictions and advance warning of likely pest infestations."
Sanitation and healthcare:
"Lack of access to basic sanitation is still a global issue affecting 2.3 billion people worldwide, including 600 million people in India. One remarkable enterprise is working in India and elsewhere to provide smart, unbreakable toilets for rural populations through the use of the internet of things (IoT) and radio-frequency identification (RFID)."
Career guidance and development:
Fully understanding the requirements and realities of a potential career path can make or break the lifelong ambitions of young people joining the job market. Accenture�s Better Careers Through Extended Reality (BecaXR) is an immersive AR/VR (augmented reality and virtual reality) mobile app that helps young jobseekers in Vietnam who often have limited knowledge about the requirements of jobs in their local market envision new careers by using 360-degree video to immerse themselves in typical workplaces. It also helps them practice key communication skills and build public speaking confidence through life-like VR simulations.
Reshaping society is possible through technology
"Emerging technology continues to drive beneficial and pragmatic long-term change in our interconnected societies, economies and shared global culture. These changes bring outcomes that benefit everyone through increased sustainability, equality and a greater sense of agency for the individual employee. While there have always been companies willing to make a positive difference, technology is giving them the means to make their ambitions a reality. As we look to the future we can be confident that the need for change is being recognised and supported by organisations"
