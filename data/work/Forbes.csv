"AI is reshaping how businesses function, but the real question is not whether AI will take over jobs. The real question is how it will change them. I recently took a class at MIT, where Thomas Malone and Danielle Li shared research that goes beyond the usual AI hype. Their insights challenged common assumptions about AI’s role in the workplace, offering a more interesting and, at times, unexpected perspective. MIT researchers reveal AI’s good and bad impact on jobs and skills, highlighting how it reshapes the workforce in ways we might not expect."
Does AI Help Less-Skilled Workers More Than Highly Skilled Workers?
"One of the most surprising findings Danielle Li presented was that AI dramatically helps lower-skilled workers, but it does not do much for high-skilled ones. She referenced her study that tracked how AI tools affected workplace performance. Her results found that employees who struggled in their roles saw major improvements when using AI, while top performers sometimes got worse. The reason? High-skilled workers relied on AI’s quick suggestions instead of using their expertise, leading to responses that were just ‘good enough’ rather than great."
"That raises an important question. If AI lifts the performance of lower-skilled employees while making highly skilled ones complacent, what happens to deep expertise over time? Li emphasized that AI reshapes the playing field. Companies need to think carefully about how they use AI, or they risk losing the very knowledge that once set them apart."
Will AI Replace Customer Service Jobs?
"The conversation about AI and job loss is nothing new, but the research shared in class suggested a more complex story. AI is automating many routine customer service tasks, reducing the need for human intervention. That does not mean jobs will disappear, but they will change."
"Li explained that AI can make customer service more efficient, reducing the number of human workers needed. But there is another possibility. If AI improves the experience so much that customers reach out more often, the demand for human service agents could grow. Instead of handling basic troubleshooting, employees might shift to a more strategic role—using AI-driven insights to improve products, spot trends, and create stronger customer relationships."
"In this scenario, AI does not eliminate customer service jobs. It turns them into something new. The companies that succeed will be the ones that rethink these roles rather than cutting them altogether."
Is AI Adoption Driven by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)?
"Many companies are scrambling to integrate AI, but is that always a good idea? Li warned against the fear of missing out (FOMO) that leads businesses to adopt AI without a clear strategy. Some companies assume that because AI is everywhere, they need to implement it immediately or risk falling behind."
"But here is the problem. If everyone is using AI in the same way, does it really give a competitive advantage? Li pointed to industries like pharmaceuticals, where AI is widely used to guide drug development. If every company is following AI’s recommendations based on the same publicly available data, they may all chase the same ideas. That could lead to fewer breakthroughs, not more."
"Therefore, AI should be a tool that amplifies a company’s strengths, not just something to check off a to-do list. The best AI strategies are the ones that align with a business’s unique goals rather than following what everyone else is doing."
Does AI Make Work More Satisfying?
"One of the most interesting discussions was about AI’s effect on job satisfaction. Many employees using AI report that they feel less stressed and more productive. AI can handle repetitive, frustrating tasks, freeing people to focus on work that feels more meaningful."
"But there is a flip side. If AI takes over too much, some employees might feel like their jobs are becoming robotic. If AI makes everything too streamlined, will workers feel less valued? Li’s research suggests that companies need to strike a balance. The goal should not be just efficiency—it should be making work better. AI should help people do their jobs, not strip them of the parts that make their roles interesting."
How Can A Culture of Curiosity Shape AI’s Impact On The Workplace?
"A culture of curiosity is the key to making AI a tool for growth rather than a shortcut to complacency. If employees are encouraged to question AI’s outputs and think critically about its role, they are less likely to rely on it passively and more likely to use it to enhance their expertise. In customer service, for example, AI can handle routine tasks, but curious employees will look for ways to use AI-driven insights to improve relationships and solve more complex problems. The same applies to AI adoption—companies that encourage curiosity do not just implement AI because everyone else is doing it; they explore how it aligns with their unique strengths. AI is changing work, but curiosity determines whether that change leads to innovation or stagnation."
The Future of AI in the Workplace
"This MIT course reinforced something I have always believed: curiosity is essential when navigating change. AI is not going away, and leaders must ask the right questions. How will AI reshape their workforce? How can they use it in a way that strengthens their company? And most importantly, how can they make sure AI enhances human expertise rather than diminishing it? MIT researchers reveal AI’s good and bad impact on jobs and skills, making it clear that AI is not just about automation. It is about augmentation. Companies that use AI to empower employees rather than replace them will be the ones that thrive in the years ahead."
